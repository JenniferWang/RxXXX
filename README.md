# RxXXX
I dumped some playground code about `ReactiveX` in this repo. I called it `RxXXX` because I may try out different languages. I am curious how this functional API is implemented in imperative languages like Java and C++. Also, ReactiveX seems to have a thread model, but how does it work with Javascript that only has a single main thread and a message queue? 

**'Shopping list'**:
* RxJava (Do we care performance?)
* RxJS
* RxCPP
* When do we want to use ReactiveX (stream abstraction and observer pattern)?
* How do we workaround when we don't have ReactiveX.
